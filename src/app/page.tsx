          DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated
          topics â€“ Data Structure and Algorithms. DSA is one of the most
          important skills that every computer science student must have. It is
          often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are
          better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of
          almost every tech giant.
